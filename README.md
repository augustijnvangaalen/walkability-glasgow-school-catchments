# walkability-glasgow-school-catchments
This portfolio relates to Augustijn van Gaalen's data science project, which looks at the walkability of Glasgow's primary and secondary school catchments.

Data Dictionary - A detailed table summarising the key variables of the data and any issues with it. This should be used in conjunction with the Raw Data file.

Hands Up Glasgow 2012 Raw Data - The original Sustrans spreadsheet which includes the full data set. This data could be used to conduct new tests or to introduce new variables into the analysis (like public transportation or private car rates).

Understanding-Opening-Summarising-Cleaning R Scripts - This file details several key commands that were used to process the data in RStudio. These can be used to transform the raw data into useable data sets that can be further processed in RStudio.

Primary School Walkability Scores - This CSV file shows the calculated Walkability Score for each of the primary school catchment areas, organised by their unique SEED No. This data be used to map walkability scores to existing school catchment areas in ArcMap.

Primary School Walkability Scores - This CSV file shows the calculated Walkability Score for each of the secondary school catchment areas, organised by their unique SEED No. This data be used to map walkability scores to existing school catchment areas in ArcMap.

Visualisation Primary School Walkability - A colour coded map showing the Walkability Scores of each primary school catchment area in Glasgow. This map was created in ArcMap.

Visualisation Secondary School Walkability - A colour coded map showing the Walkability Scores of each secondary school catchment area in Glasgow. This map was created in ArcMap.

Geographically Weighted Regression Model - A visual overview of areas where the Geographically Weighted Regression Model performs well and poorly. The model explores the relationship between school catchment size and Walkability Scores. The model performs particularly well in city centre areas.
